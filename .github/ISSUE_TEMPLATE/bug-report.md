Before you create an issue:

* GitHub issues are for bug reports and feature requests. Do not create GitHub issues to get support with running a Python script. This code is provided for free. It does not come with technical support.
* Do not ask about Ausländerbehörde appointments. I cannot and will not add this feature.
* Do not create issues for 4XX or 5XX errors from Berlin.de. There is no way to fix them on our side.
